# Number of Packages on CRAN depending on, importing, or suggesting {ggplot2} #

# Inspiration ----

# Georgios Karamanis shared their recent Tidy Tuesday visualization on LinkedIn:
# https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgios-karamanis-a54926153_tidytuesday-rstats-dataviz-activity-7111680233430224896-EdtA/

# Here's a link to the GitHub repo:
# https://github.com/gkaramanis/tidytuesday/tree/master/2023/2023-week_38

# The thing is, Georgios' original graph shows the years for the LATEST release of the ggplot2-related
# packages on CRAN. While that is an interesting question, I've been trying to find out a good data
# source for another question: what are the years for the initial releases of those packages. That
# question led me down a rabbit hole and I eventually found {pkgsearch}.

# So what I did was take Georgios' original code (with their blessing) and
# 1) change the data source (using {pkgsearch})
# 2) use {purrr} to easily get all the ggplot2-related packages' metadata
# 3) bring in a third type/category
# 4) make the stream chart less 'wavy'
# 5) change the color scheme
# 6) change the fonts to Roboto Mono (using {showtext})
# 7) annotate all the major ggplot2 releases
# 8) other, smaller changes

# I'm thankful to Georgios for their support and continuing inspiration. If you're interested in data
# visualization, they are one of the people to follow.

# One more thing, this visualization is part of the background work I'm doing for my upcoming book
# about ggplot2 extension packages called 'ggplot2 extended' (working title). If you are interested in
# seeing how that project advances, you can start by following me on LinkedIn. I'm also happy to have
# conversations about the different ggplot2 extensions, if you have strong opinions and/or knowledge
# about them. So, don't hesitate to DM me on LinkedIn! Do mention it's about ggplot2 and the response
# rate will be significantly higher...

## Fetch dependencies for the latest version of the packages ----
ggplot2_dependencies <- ggplot2_history %>%

  # Have to unnest dependencies first. The nested column contains 'type', which is the type of
  # dependency (depends/enhances/imports/suggests) and 'package', which is the package towards
  # which there is that dependency. The confusing part is that we already have the column Package.
  # But we're only using package to filter in only the ones that mention ggplot2 as a dependency.
